* docs: enhance workflow infrastructure guide accessibility across agent configurations

Add workflow infrastructure guide references to all agent configurations to ensure
proper understanding of GitHub Actions automation system.

Changes:
- Add workflow guide reference to all 6 development agent configurations
- Update DevOps agent to always load workflow infrastructure documentation
- Enhance desktop project instructions for orchestrator access
- Ensure consistent access patterns across vibe-coder, devops, laravel-dev,
  node-dev, react-dev, and svelte-dev agents

This ensures agents can properly coordinate with GitHub Actions workflows and
understand their role in the automated multi-agent coordination system.

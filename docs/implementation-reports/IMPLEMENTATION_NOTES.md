# Pre-commit Hook Integration & Interactive Branch Protection Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides simplified, practical safety enhancements to the branch protection system through static pre-commit hooks and command-line assistance tools.

## Components Implemented

### 1. Pre-commit Hook Integration

#### Static Safety Hooks
- **Location**: `scripts/hooks/`
- **Configuration**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- **Approach**: Static validation of critical rules without dynamic generation complexity

#### Hook Scripts:

**`check-branch-naming.sh`**
- Validates branch names follow `{agent-name}/{task-type}/{descriptive-name}` pattern
- Provides clear guidance on valid agents and task types
- References CLAUDE.md safety rules in error messages

**`check-protected-branches.sh`**
- Prevents direct commits to main/stage/test branches
- Explains 5-branch strategy in violation messages
- Provides remediation steps for protected branch violations

**`validate-claude-md.sh`**
- Ensures CLAUDE.md file exists and contains required sections
- Validates presence of 6 critical safety sections
- Checks for 5-branch strategy documentation

**`check-safety-rules.sh`**
- Scans for potential secrets in staged files
- Detects --no-verify usage violations
- Identifies deletion of important files
- Requires review markers for workflow changes

#### Pre-commit Configuration
- **File**: `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- **Approach**: Local repository hooks (no external dependencies)
- **Staging**: Different hooks for pre-commit vs pre-push stages
- **Scripts**: Reference local `scripts/hooks/` directory

### 2. Interactive Branch Protection Guidance

#### Enhanced Workflow Error Messages
- **File**: `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml`
- **Approach**: Detailed, actionable error messages instead of terse failures
- **Improvements**:
  - Clear explanation of what went wrong
  - Step-by-step remediation instructions
  - Examples of correct patterns
  - References to relevant CLAUDE.md sections

#### Branch Check Command
- **File**: `scripts/branch-check`
- **Purpose**: Simple command-line validation of current repository state
- **Features**:
  - Color-coded output for quick scanning
  - 5 safety checks: branch naming, CLAUDE.md, protected branches, staging area, pre-commit hooks
  - Actionable recommendations
  - Summary score with quick fixes

#### Key Enhancements to Workflow Messages:

**CLAUDE.md Validation**
- Lists missing sections clearly
- Provides setup guidance for new repositories
- References existing examples

**Branch Naming Violations**
- Shows current vs required format
- Lists all valid agents with descriptions
- Provides git command to fix branch name

**Pull Request Target Validation**
- Explains correct workflow progression
- Shows source → target branch relationships
- Provides step-by-step PR fix instructions

## Design Decisions

### Simplified Approach
- **Static hooks** instead of dynamic generation from CLAUDE.md
- **Command-line assistance** rather than building a new TUI system
- **Enhanced error messages** instead of complex real-time feedback

### Immediate Safety Benefits
- Catches violations before commits reach remote repository
- Provides educational guidance to improve agent understanding
- Maintains compatibility with existing workflows

### Practical Implementation
- No external dependencies beyond standard git/bash tools
- Simple installation: `pip install pre-commit && pre-commit install`
- Works with existing agentic development patterns

## Testing Results

### Pre-commit Hooks
- ✅ Branch naming validation correctly identifies violations
- ✅ CLAUDE.md validation passes with complete safety file
- ✅ Safety rules check works without false positives
- ✅ Protected branch check prevents direct commits

### Branch Check Command
- ✅ Correctly identifies current branch naming issue
- ✅ Validates CLAUDE.md completeness
- ✅ Detects pre-commit hook installation status
- ✅ Provides clear summary and remediation steps

### Enhanced Workflow Messages
- ✅ Detailed CLAUDE.md missing sections guidance
- ✅ Clear branch naming violation explanations
- ✅ Step-by-step PR target branch fix instructions

## Integration with Existing System

### Branch Tracking System
- Pre-commit hooks work alongside existing branch tracking
- Validation results can be recorded in branch tracking system
- No interference with current workflows

### Existing Workflows
- Enhanced error messages maintain compatibility
- No changes to workflow triggers or logic
- Additive improvements to user experience

### Agent Coordination
- CLAUDE.md remains the central safety document
- Pre-commit hooks enforce CLAUDE.md rules locally
- Enhanced error messages educate agents on proper procedures

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Phase 1 Complete ✅
- Static pre-commit hooks for critical rules
- Basic CLAUDE.md validation
- Enhanced workflow error messages
- Simple branch-check command

### Phase 2 Possibilities
- Integration with branch tracking for validation state persistence
- Agent capability-based validation extensions  
- Automated hook script updates when CLAUDE.md changes
- Pre-commit hook metrics and reporting

### Phase 3 Advanced Features
- Dynamic hook generation from CLAUDE.md rules
- Real-time feedback during git operations
- ML-based violation prediction
- Cross-repository hook synchronization

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml` - Pre-commit hook configuration
- `scripts/hooks/check-branch-naming.sh` - Branch naming validation
- `scripts/hooks/check-protected-branches.sh` - Protected branch prevention
- `scripts/hooks/validate-claude-md.sh` - CLAUDE.md completeness check
- `scripts/hooks/check-safety-rules.sh` - General safety rules validation
- `scripts/branch-check` - Interactive validation command

### Enhanced Files
- `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml` - Improved error messages
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added safety tools documentation section

### Integration Points
- Branch tracking system remains compatible
- Existing workflows continue functioning
- Agent coordination patterns preserved

## Conclusion

This implementation provides immediate, practical safety improvements through static validation hooks and enhanced user guidance. The simplified approach delivers real value without over-engineering, while maintaining compatibility with the existing agentic development ecosystem.

The tools work together to provide a comprehensive safety net:
1. **Pre-commit hooks** catch violations before they reach the repository
2. **Enhanced error messages** educate agents when violations occur
3. **Branch-check command** provides proactive validation and guidance
4. **Updated CLAUDE.md** documents the new safety tools

This foundation can be extended in future phases while providing immediate benefits to agent safety and coordination.

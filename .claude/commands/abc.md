# ABC: Always Be Closing - Task Completion Pressure System

The ABC command applies structured pressure to close out tasks and merge PRs by providing an exact checklist of what needs to happen next. ABC maintains all development principles (TDD, DRY, KISS, D/E) while encouraging forward momentum.

## Arguments Provided
`$ARGUMENTS`

## Current Repository State
- Repository: !`git remote get-url origin | sed 's/.*\///' | sed 's/\.git//'`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`
- Working directory: !`pwd`

## ABC Core Principle

**A**lways **B**e **C**losing: Every task should have a clear path to completion and merge. This command identifies exactly what step you need to take next rather than letting tasks sit idle.

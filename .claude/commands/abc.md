# ABC: Always Be Closing - Multi-Agent Workflow Completion

The ABC command applies structured pressure to drive tasks toward **merge-ready state** in our multi-agent worktree development workflow. ABC ensures proper GitHub issue tracking, agent assignment, and AI review integration while maintaining quality standards.

## Arguments Provided
`$ARGUMENTS`

## Workflow Context Detection

I'll analyze your current development context to provide accurate guidance:

### Worktree Environment Analysis
- Repository: !`git remote get-url origin 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*\///' | sed 's/\.git//' || echo "Unknown"`
- Current location: !`pwd | sed "s|$HOME|~|"`
- Branch pattern: !`git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo "No branch"`
- Worktree status: !`[[ "$(pwd)" == *"/worktrees/"* ]] && echo "‚úÖ Agent worktree" || echo "‚ö†Ô∏è Main repository"`

### Agent Context Detection
- Agent identification: !`echo "$PWD" | grep -o 'worktrees/[^/]*/[^/]*' | cut -d'/' -f2-3 || echo "Not in agent worktree"`
- Expected branch format: `agent-name/task-type/description`

## ABC Multi-Agent Workflow Compliance

### üîç Phase 1: Workflow Foundation Validation
**Critical Requirements for Multi-Agent Development**

#### GitHub Issue Integration ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Issue Created**: Task has dedicated GitHub issue (via `gh issue create` or `/start-session`)
- [ ] **Issue Assignment**: Issue assigned to correct agent
- [ ] **Issue Labels**: Proper labels applied (agent-task, priority level)
- [ ] **Issue Status**: Issue status reflects current work state
- [ ] **Context Comments**: Issue has agent communication following GitHub Comment Standards

#### Agent Worktree Setup ‚úÖ  
- [ ] **Proper Worktree**: Working in isolated agent worktree (not main repo)
- [ ] **Branch Naming**: Follows `agent/type/description` pattern exactly
- [ ] **Setup Script Used**: Worktree created via `setup-agent-task.sh` 
- [ ] **Remote Tracking**: Branch properly tracks remote origin
- [ ] **Clean Workspace**: No uncommitted changes blocking progress

#### Agent Assignment Validation ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Correct Agent**: Work matches agent specialization and scope
- [ ] **Authority Granted**: Vibe-coder authorization obtained if required
- [ ] **Scope Compliance**: All file modifications within agent scope
- [ ] **Coordination Protocol**: Following agent communication standards

### üîÑ Phase 2: Development Quality Gates
**Quality Standards for Multi-Agent Coordination**

#### Code Quality & Testing ‚úÖ
- [ ] **TDD Compliance**: Tests written before implementation (MANDATORY)
- [ ] **Test Coverage**: All new code has corresponding test files
- [ ] **Tests Passing**: `npm test` or equivalent passes completely
- [ ] **Linting Clean**: `npm run lint` passes without errors
- [ ] **DRY Principle**: No code duplication without justification

#### Multi-Agent Integration ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Cross-Agent Dependencies**: Dependencies on other agents documented
- [ ] **API Compatibility**: Changes maintain compatibility with other components
- [ ] **Configuration Updates**: Environment configurations updated if needed
- [ ] **Documentation Sync**: Changes reflected in relevant documentation
- [ ] **Breaking Changes**: Breaking changes properly communicated

### üöÄ Phase 3: AI-Reviewed Merge Preparation
**AI Reviewer Integration for Quality Assurance**

#### AI Review Integration ‚úÖ
- [ ] **Gemini Code Assist**: Invoked with `@gemini-code-assist` for technical review
- [ ] **Greptile Analysis**: Code analysis completed (if applicable)
- [ ] **Review Feedback**: AI reviewer feedback addressed completely
- [ ] **Security Validation**: AI security analysis passed
- [ ] **Performance Review**: AI performance impact assessment completed

#### PR & Merge Readiness ‚úÖ
- [ ] **PR Created**: Pull request created targeting **dev branch** (never main)
- [ ] **PR Description**: Comprehensive description with test plan
- [ ] **Issue Linking**: PR properly linked to originating GitHub issue
- [ ] **Conventional Commits**: Commit messages follow conventional format
- [ ] **Review Complete**: All AI reviewer suggestions addressed
- [ ] **Merge Conflicts**: No conflicts with target branch (dev)

## ABC Workflow-Specific Analysis

### Multi-Agent Context Assessment
I'll analyze your specific situation within our workflow:

1. **Worktree Validation**: Ensure you're in proper agent worktree, not main repo
2. **Issue Tracking**: Verify GitHub issue exists and is properly linked
3. **Branch Compliance**: Check `agent/type/description` naming pattern
4. **Agent Scope**: Confirm work is within authorized agent boundaries
5. **AI Review Status**: Check AI reviewer integration and feedback status

### Workflow-Specific Action Items

Based on our multi-agent worktree workflow, here are your next steps:

#### If Missing GitHub Issue:
```bash
# Create issue for task tracking
gh issue create --title "[AGENT-TASK] Your Task Title" --body "Task description"
# Link to current work
gh issue comment [issue-number] --body "Working in branch: $(git branch --show-current)"
```

#### If Not in Agent Worktree:
```bash
# Navigate to or create proper worktree
cd ~/Code/Tuvens/tuvens-docs/worktrees/[agent]/[agent]/[task-type]/[description]
# Or use setup script
./agentic-development/scripts/setup-agent-task.sh [agent] "[task]" "[description]"
```

#### If AI Review Missing:
```bash
# Invoke Gemini Code Assist
gh pr comment [pr-number] --body "@gemini-code-assist review this implementation"
# Check for Greptile integration
gh pr comment [pr-number] --body "@greptileai"
```

## Next Step Identification

I'll identify your exact next step based on our actual workflow:

### Workflow Decision Tree
1. **No GitHub Issue** ‚Üí Create issue with `/create-issue` or `gh issue create`
2. **Wrong Location** ‚Üí Move to proper agent worktree
3. **Branch Name Wrong** ‚Üí Rename branch to `agent/type/description` format
4. **Code Not Ready** ‚Üí Complete TDD cycle and quality gates
5. **No AI Review** ‚Üí Invoke AI reviewers before merge
6. **Ready to Merge** ‚Üí Target dev branch and complete merge

### AI-Specific Pressure Levels

- üî¥ **HIGH PRESSURE**: Issue blocking other agents or overdue
- üü° **MEDIUM PRESSURE**: On track but needs AI review completion  
- üü¢ **LOW PRESSURE**: Ahead of schedule, focus on quality

## Tuvens-Specific Safety & Quality Gates

### Workflow Compliance Validation
- **CLAUDE.md Safety Rules**: All agent safety protocols followed
- **Branch Strategy**: Proper `agent/type/description` ‚Üí dev ‚Üí test ‚Üí stage ‚Üí main flow
- **Agent Scope Protection**: File modifications within declared agent scope
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Proper handoff and communication protocols
- **AI Review Integration**: Gemini/Greptile feedback incorporated

### Success Criteria for Completion
1. ‚úÖ GitHub issue created and properly assigned
2. ‚úÖ Work completed in isolated agent worktree
3. ‚úÖ Branch follows naming convention exactly
4. ‚úÖ All code quality gates passed (TDD, linting, testing)  
5. ‚úÖ AI reviewers invoked and feedback addressed
6. ‚úÖ PR created targeting dev branch with proper description
7. ‚úÖ Issue linked and ready for vibe-coder validation

Let me analyze your current situation and provide the exact next step to move your task toward merge-ready state in our multi-agent workflow.

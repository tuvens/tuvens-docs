## Commands by Category

### üåê Cross-Repository Communication

These commands facilitate coordination between different repositories in the Tuvens ecosystem:

#### [`/ask-question`](ask-question.md)
Ask questions about another repository's implementation, API, or architecture when clarification is needed for integration work.

**When to use:**
- Need clarification on API behavior or parameters
- Understanding integration requirements
- Clarifying implementation details before development

**Example scenarios:**
- "How does the event filtering API handle date ranges across different timezones?"
- "What authentication method should be used for webhook endpoints?"

#### [`/report-bug`](report-bug.md)
Report bugs in another repository that affect the current project's integration or functionality.

**When to use:**
- External API returning unexpected responses
- Integration failures due to external system issues
- Dependency issues affecting current development

**Example scenarios:**
- Authentication endpoint returns 500 error with valid tokens
- Webhook delivery failures or malformed payloads
- API rate limiting not matching documented limits

#### [`/send-rqts`](send-rqts.md)
Request features, changes, or capabilities from another repository that are needed for current development work.

**When to use:**
- Need new API endpoints or functionality
- Request changes to existing behavior
- Propose new features for ecosystem integration

**Example scenarios:**
- Need webhook endpoint with real-time event filtering
- Request additional data fields in API responses
- Propose new authentication methods for enhanced security

#### [`/refactor-code`](refactor-code.md)
Optimize and refactor code from first principles for maintainability and scalability while preserving functionality.

**When to use:**
- Code cleanup and organization
- Performance optimization
- Architecture improvements
- Configuration management

**Capabilities:**
- Multi-agent workflow integration for complex refactoring
- Comprehensive code analysis and dependency mapping
- Configuration externalization and validation

#### [`/resolve-issue`](resolve-issue.md)
Analyze and resolve GitHub issues with proper closure, documentation, and workflow integration.

**When to use:**
- Fixing bugs reported in GitHub issues
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Addressing technical debt items
- Implementing feature requests

**Features:**
- Multi-agent workflow support for complex issues
- Automatic issue closure upon resolution
- Git workflow integration with proper push procedures
- Comprehensive validation and testing

### üìã Task Management

Commands for managing development tasks, issues, and agent coordination:

#### [`/create-issue`](create-issue.md)
Create GitHub issues with proper agent workflow templates and lifecycle management for coordinated development.

- Creating tasks for other agents
- Coordinating multi-agent development work
- Establishing clear task ownership and requirements

**Features:**
- Structured agent workflow templates
- Clear assignment and authority definition
- Complete lifecycle management protocols

- Creating isolated development environments
- Setting up agent-specific workflows

**Automation features:**
- Environment validation and setup
- GitHub issue creation with templates
- Worktree setup with proper directory structure
- iTerm2 integration and context file support

### üìö Documentation Management

Commands for maintaining project documentation and state tracking:

#### [`/update-current-state`](update-current-state.md)
Update project current state documentation with consistent formatting and comprehensive change tracking.

**When to use:**
- End of development sessions
- Major milestone completions
- Documenting decisions and progress

**Formatting requirements:**
- Strict timestamp formatting (UTC with full dates)

- Historical preservation
- Consistent emoji and formatting standards

## Usage Guidelines

### Command Execution
All commands are invoked using the slash prefix in Claude Code:
```
/command-name arguments
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination
Several commands integrate with the multi-agent workflow system:
- Complex tasks are automatically delegated to appropriate specialized agents
- Proper issue tracking and worktree organization
- Coordinated development with clear ownership and accountability

### Safety and Compliance
All commands follow Tuvens ecosystem safety protocols:
- Branch protection and naming validation
- Pre-commit hook integration
- Never bypass quality checks or safety measures
- Proper git workflow with --force-with-lease safety

### Integration Points
Commands integrate with:
- `.github/workflows/` - Automated validation and CI/CD
- `agentic-development/` - Multi-agent coordination system
- Branch tracking and worktree organization
- Cross-repository sync automation

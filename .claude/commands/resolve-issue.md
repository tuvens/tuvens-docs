# Resolve GitHub Issue

Please analyze and resolve the GitHub issue: $ARGUMENTS

## Agent Workflow Integration

**IMPORTANT**: For complex issue resolution, this should be handled through the multi-agent workflow system.

### Step 1: Issue Analysis
First, I'll analyze the issue to determine the appropriate resolution approach:

!`gh issue view $ARGUMENTS`

### Step 2: Determine Resolution Strategy
Based on the issue complexity and type:

**For Simple Issues** (merge conflicts, minor bug fixes, documentation updates):
- Proceed with direct resolution in current session

**For Complex Issues** (feature implementation, architectural changes, multi-file refactoring):
- Use `/start-session [appropriate-agent]` to create dedicated resolution environment
- The agent session will:
  - Load complete issue context
  - Create isolated worktree for safe resolution
  - Follow proper development workflow
  - Ensure comprehensive testing and validation
  - Properly document the resolution process

## Direct Resolution Process

If proceeding with direct resolution in current session:

1. Use `gh issue view $ARGUMENTS` to get the full issue details
2. Understand the conflict or problem described in the issue
3. If it's a branch conflict:
   - Check current branch status with `git status`
   - Extract branch name from issue title or description
   - Ensure we're on the correct branch: `git checkout [branch-name]` if needed
   - Fetch latest develop: `git fetch origin develop`
   - Rebase current branch: `git rebase origin/develop`
   - Resolve any merge conflicts that arise
   - **SAFE FORCE PUSH**: Use `git push --force-with-lease origin [branch-name]`
     * SAFETY NOTE: `--force-with-lease` prevents data loss by checking remote hasn't changed
     * This is the standard safe practice for pushing rebased branches
     * Alternative would create messy merge commits in history
   - Verify branch is now up to date with `git status`
   - **WORKFLOW ENABLEMENT**: After successful push, comment on issue: "âœ… Conflicts resolved and branch pushed. Workflow will now create PR automatically."
4. If it's a code issue:
   - Search the codebase for relevant files
   - Implement the necessary changes to fix the issue
   - Write and run tests to verify the fix
   - Ensure code passes linting and type checking
   - Create descriptive commit messages
   - **CRITICAL**: Push changes: `git push origin [branch-name]`
5. **ðŸš¨ MANDATORY: CLOSE ISSUES IMMEDIATELY AFTER RESOLUTION**
   For EACH resolved issue number in $ARGUMENTS:
   - Run: `gh issue close [ISSUE_NUMBER] --comment "âœ… Resolved: [Brief description of what was fixed]"`
   - Verify closure with: `gh issue view [ISSUE_NUMBER]` (should show state: CLOSED)
   - **CRITICAL**: This must be done for EVERY issue number, even when resolving multiple issues
   - **NO EXCEPTIONS**: If you resolve an issue, you MUST close it immediately
6. **IMPORTANT**: If the issue was generated by Gemini, it will have a comment on the associated PR where it was created. To resolve it:
   - Implement simple and necessary fixes directly.
   - For larger issues, keep them open and add a response that includes a task description (e.g., frontend, devOps, configuration).
   - Respond to the original Gemini comment with the solution for each point, even if you concluded an issue was invalid.
7. **VERIFICATION**: Confirm that the push will trigger the GitHub Actions workflow to create the PR

Remember:
   - use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for all GitHub-related tasks
   - The key is to PUSH after resolving so the workflow triggers again to create the PR
   - **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL REMINDER: ALWAYS CLOSE RESOLVED ISSUES WITH `gh issue close [NUMBER]`**
   - **VERIFICATION**: After resolving multiple issues, run `gh issue list --state open` to confirm all resolved issues are closed

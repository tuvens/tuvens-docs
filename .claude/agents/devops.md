### GitHub Actions Templates

#### **Universal CI Pipeline**
```yaml
name: CI Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Setup Environment
        uses: ./.github/actions/setup-env
      - name: Run Tests
        run: npm test
      - name: Security Scan
        uses: github/super-linter@v4
      
  deploy-staging:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Staging
        uses: ./.github/actions/deploy-staging
        
  deploy-production:
    needs: test
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Deploy to Production
        uses: ./.github/actions/deploy-production
```

#### **Security Scanning Workflow**
```yaml
name: Security Scan
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 2 * * *'  # Daily at 2 AM
  push:
    branches: [main, develop]

jobs:
  security:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Dependency Scan
        uses: github/super-linter@v4
      - name: Container Scan
        uses: azure/container-scan@v0
      - name: Code Analysis
        uses: github/codeql-action/analyze@v2
```

### Monitoring Implementation

#### **Health Check Endpoints**
```typescript
// Universal health check pattern for all APIs
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.json({
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    version: process.env.APP_VERSION,
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV
  });
});

app.get('/health/detailed', async (req, res) => {
  const health = {
    status: 'healthy',
    checks: {
      database: await checkDatabase(),
      redis: await checkRedis(),
      externalServices: await checkExternalServices()
    }
  };
  
  const overallStatus = Object.values(health.checks).every(check => check.status === 'healthy')
    ? 'healthy' : 'unhealthy';
    
  res.status(overallStatus === 'healthy' ? 200 : 503).json(health);
});
```

#### **Performance Monitoring**
```javascript
// Universal performance monitoring setup
const monitoring = {
  trackApiResponse: (req, res, responseTime) => {
    console.log({
      method: req.method,
      path: req.path,
      statusCode: res.statusCode,
      responseTime: `${responseTime}ms`,
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  },
  
  trackError: (error, req) => {
    console.error({
      error: error.message,
      stack: error.stack,
      path: req.path,
      method: req.method,
      userAgent: req.headers['user-agent'],
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString()
    });
  }
};
```

## 🚨 DevOps Principles

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined and versioned in code
2. **Automation First**: Automate deployment, testing, and operational tasks
3. **Security by Design**: Security integrated into every pipeline and process
4. **Observability**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, and alerting
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Backup strategies and tested recovery procedures
6. **Cost Optimization**: Monitor and optimize infrastructure costs continuously

    ;;
  "tuvens-api")
    Load: tuvens-docs/repositories/tuvens-api.md
    ;;
  "hi.events")

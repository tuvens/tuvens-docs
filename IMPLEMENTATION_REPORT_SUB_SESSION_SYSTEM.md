5. **Start Sub-Session Command** - Easy-to-use session creation with integration
6. **Cleanup Automation** - Automated maintenance and session lifecycle management
7. **Integration Layer** - Unified interface connecting all components

### ✅ Main Features Implemented

#### Permission-Based Access Control
- **Restricted Mode** - Limited to specific allowed paths only
- **Expanded Mode** - Broader access with critical file protection
- **Custom Mode** - Fully customizable permission sets
- **Auto-Approval Rules** - Smart approval for safe operations

#### File Lock Management
- **Read Locks** - Multiple readers with write conflict prevention
- **Write Locks** - Exclusive write access with automatic acquisition
- **Exclusive Locks** - Complete isolation for critical operations
- **Conflict Detection** - Automatic detection and resolution suggestions

#### Coordination Mechanisms
- **Inter-Session Communication** - Structured coordination protocols
- **Conflict Resolution** - Multiple resolution strategies (wait, coordinate, partition, sequential)
- **System Health Monitoring** - Comprehensive health assessment and recommendations
- **Branch Tracking Integration** - Seamless integration with existing agent tracking

#### Runtime Safety
- **Claude Operation Interception** - Validates all file operations before execution
- **Automatic Lock Acquisition** - Prevents conflicts through proactive locking
- **Permission Request Flow** - Guided permission escalation when needed
- **Session Detection** - Automatic detection of sub-session mode

### ✅ Integration Points

#### With Existing Branch Tracking
- Sub-sessions appear in `active-branches.json`
- Coordination with main agent sessions
- Task group integration for related work

#### With Claude Desktop/Code
- Automatic session detection in Claude prompts
- Runtime validation of all tool operations
- Permission request suggestions in error messages

#### With GitHub Actions
- Event tracking through existing workflows
- Automated cleanup triggers
- Coordination reporting on merge events

```

## Usage Examples

### Starting a Sub-Session
```bash
# Basic restricted session
bash agentic-development/scripts/start-sub-session.sh vibe-coder test-runner "Run integration tests"

# Expanded access with specific paths
bash agentic-development/scripts/start-sub-session.sh --access-mode expanded --allow "docs/,tests/" backend-dev validator "API validation"
```

### Working in Sub-Sessions
```bash
# Setup workspace
cd sub-sessions/[session-id]
source .env-sub-session
claude  # Start with automatically generated prompt

# Check file access
node agentic-development/scripts/claude-access-validator.js check-file [session-id] /path/to/file.js

# Request additional permissions
node agentic-development/scripts/sub-session-manager.js request-permission [session-id] /path/to/file.js file-access "Need for sub-task"
```

### System Monitoring
```bash
# View dashboard
node agentic-development/scripts/sub-session-integration.js dashboard

# Detect conflicts
node agentic-development/scripts/coordination-manager.js detect-conflicts

# Run maintenance
bash agentic-development/scripts/sub-session-cleanup.sh --auto
```

## Security Features

### Access Control Boundaries
- Path-based restrictions with automatic denial of critical files
- Permission escalation path for legitimate needs
- Auto-approval for safe documentation operations

### Conflict Prevention
- Automatic file lock acquisition for write operations
- Deadlock detection and resolution
- Safe parallel work patterns with coordination

### Audit Trail
- Complete history of all operations in lock history
- Permission request tracking with justifications
- Session lifecycle logging for accountability

## Testing Results

Successfully tested the complete system:

1. **System Initialization** ✅
   - Created registry files and coordination logs
   - Initialized permission structures

2. **Session Creation** ✅  
   - Created test sub-session with proper restrictions
   - Generated workspace and Claude prompt automatically
   - Integrated with branch tracking system

3. **System Status** ✅
   - Monitored active sessions and locks
   - Generated coordination reports
   - Assessed system health (100% healthy)

4. **Session Cleanup** ✅
   - Properly ended test session
   - Released all resources
   - Updated tracking systems

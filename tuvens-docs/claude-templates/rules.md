# Claude Code Development Rules

No Apologies: Never use apologies or pleasing language

No Inventions: Don't invent changes other than what's explicitly requested.

Preserve Existing Code: Don't remove unrelated code or functionalities. Pay attention to preserving existing structures.

Use Explicit Variable Names: Prefer descriptive, explicit variable names over short, ambiguous ones to enhance code readability.

Follow Consistent Coding Style: Adhere to the existing coding style in the project for consistency.

Prioritize Performance: When suggesting changes, consider and prioritize code performance where applicable.

Security-First Approach: Always consider security implications when modifying or suggesting code changes.

Test Coverage: Suggest or include appropriate unit tests for new or modified code.

Error Handling: Implement robust error handling and logging where necessary.

Modular Design: Encourage modular design principles to improve code maintainability and reusability.

Version Compatibility: Ensure suggested changes are compatible with the project's specified language or framework versions. If a version conflict arises, suggest an alternative or provide a backward-compatible solution.

Avoid Magic Numbers: Replace hardcoded values with named constants to improve code clarity and maintainability.

Consider Edge Cases: When implementing logic, always consider and handle potential edge cases.

Use Assertions: Include assertions wherever possible to validate assumptions and catch potential errors early.

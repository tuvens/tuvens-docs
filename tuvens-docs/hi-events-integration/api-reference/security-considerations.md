# üõ°Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Input Validation
- All JSON payloads validated against schemas
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- XSS prevention through output encoding
- CSRF protection on state-changing operations

### Token Security
- Session tokens are cryptographically secure (32 random bytes)
- Tokens expire after 15 minutes
- Timing-safe comparisons for all token validation
- Automatic cleanup of expired sessions

### Webhook Security
- HMAC-SHA256 signature verification required
- Replay attack prevention through timestamp validation
- IP allowlisting for Hi.Events webhook sources
- Payload size limits to prevent DoS attacks

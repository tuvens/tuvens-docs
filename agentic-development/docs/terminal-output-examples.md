# Terminal Output Examples for Desktop Agent Setup Debugging

## Working Temp Script Output (Verbose)

This is the current output from `setup-agent-task-desktop-temp.sh` that works but has issues:

```
🏢 Claude Desktop Agent Setup (via iTerm2 MCP)
==============================================

Step 1: Running core agent setup (without iTerm automation)...

Step 1a: Creating GitHub issue for Claude Desktop mode...
✅ Created GitHub issue #392
   URL: https://github.com/tuvens/tuvens-docs/issues/392
./agentic-development/scripts/setup-agent-task-desktop-temp.sh: line 100: temp_body_file: unbound variable

💡 CONTEXT ENHANCEMENT GUIDANCE
================================

📋 For complex tasks requiring detailed analysis or planning:

   1. Add a GitHub comment with complete context using this format:
      👤 **Identity**: [your-agent-name] (coordinating agent)
      🎯 **Addressing**: devops

      ## Complete Context Analysis
      [Include your detailed analysis, findings, and requirements]

   2. Include specific implementation guidance, discovered patterns,
      file locations, and any complex requirements you've identified

   3. Add timeline expectations and coordination notes if relevant

   Command to add context comment:
   gh issue comment    Creating issue: Test Workflow Fixed
392 --body-file /path/to/context.md

   This prevents the receiving agent from having to rediscover
   context that you already have, improving task handoff efficiency.

Step 1b: Running core agent setup (without GitHub issue creation and iTerm automation)...
🚀 Setting up agent task: devops
========================================
Task: Test Workflow Fixed
Description: Testing the fixed agent session workflow after resolving unbound variables

Step 1: Environment validation and shared library setup...
🔍 Multi-Agent Environment Validation
=====================================
✅ Checking git repository status...
   ✓ Git repository detected
✅ Validating paths...
   ✓ Path validation passed
✅ Checking branch status...
   ✓ Current branch: dev
✅ Checking worktree structure...
   ✓ Repository structure exists at: /Users/ciarancarroll/Code/Tuvens/tuvens-docs
✅ Checking GitHub CLI...
   ✓ GitHub CLI available and authenticated
✅ Checking iTerm2...
   ✓ iTerm2 available

🎉 Environment validation PASSED
Ready for multi-agent operations

[... continues with more verbose output ...]

📋 Agent Context:
================
• GitHub Issue: #
• Worktree: ~/Code/Tuvens/tuvens-docs/worktrees/devops/devops/feature/test-workflow-fixed
• Branch: devops/feature/test-workflow-fixed

✅ Changed to worktree directory: /Users/ciarancarroll/Code/Tuvens/tuvens-docs/worktrees/devops/devops/feature/test-workflow-fixed

🎯 COPY THIS PROMPT FOR CLAUDE CODE:
=====================================
[... garbled prompt with malformed issue numbers ...]

🚀 Launching Claude Code...
When Claude Code opens, copy and paste the prompt above.

✅ No active reviews detected, enabling dangerous mode for faster development
Launching: claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

## Clean Claude Code Output (Desired)

This is what the output looks like when Claude Code starts - clean and minimal:

```
 ✻ Welcome to Claude Code!

   /help for help, /status for your current setup

   cwd: /Users/ciarancarroll/Code/Tuvens/tuvens-docs/worktrees/devops/devops/feature/test-workflow-fixed

## Issues Identified

1. **Unbound Variable Error**: `temp_body_file: unbound variable` at line 100
2. **Garbled Issue Numbers**: GitHub issue references show malformed text like `#   Creating issue: Test Workflow Fixed\n392`
3. **Excessive Verbosity**: Desktop script outputs ~100 lines vs Claude Code's clean ~10 lines
4. **Nested Worktree Paths**: Second terminal showed concerning nested paths suggesting worktrees inside worktrees

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Unbound Variable at Line 100
The script references `temp_body_file` but never declares it. This is likely from a copy-paste or variable naming inconsistency.

### Issue 2: Garbled Issue Numbers  
The GitHub issue parsing fails when issue creation output contains newlines or extra text:
```bash
echo "• GitHub Issue: #$(grep -o 'GitHub Issue: #[0-9]\+' "$PROMPT_FILE" | cut -d'#' -f2)"
```

### Issue 3: Excessive Verbosity
The desktop script shows all core script output instead of filtering it, making it 10x more verbose than needed.

### Issue 4: Nested Worktree Paths
Worktrees might be created inside other worktrees, creating confusing nested directory structures.

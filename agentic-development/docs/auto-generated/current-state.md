* docs: split desktop-project-instructions README into focused micro-docs

Split the 417-line README.md into 5 focused files for better navigation:
- README.md: Main entry point with navigation and quick start
- agent-management.md: Agent sessions, task routing, worktree management
- wiki-integration.md: Complete wiki workflow and content management
- handoff-templates.md: Templates and inter-agent communication
- advanced-usage.md: Best practices, context loading, and scenarios

All content preserved with improved organization and navigation.

* fix: replace hardcoded absolute paths with relative paths

Address Gemini Code Assist feedback by converting all hardcoded absolute
paths to relative paths for better portability across development machines:

- agentic-development/branch-tracking/active-branches.json: 13 worktree path fixes
- agentic-development/scripts/devops-prompt.txt: 2 path fixes
- agentic-development/scripts/vibe-coder-prompt.txt: 2 path fixes

This ensures the agentic development framework works consistently across
different developer environments without exposing local filesystem details.

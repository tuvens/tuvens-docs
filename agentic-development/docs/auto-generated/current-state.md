## Branch Information

- **Commit SHA**: 90fa67bc88792a5a8ebd56efa37b1cbf29645c7b
- **Commit Message**: rollback: revert failed PR #354 - incomplete desktop instructions session

This reverts commit bab98749ad37552f632320bcdcf93a10909cd671.

Rationale for rollback:
- PR #354 was identified as 'entirely failed session' by user
- Core task was not completed properly despite massive file changes
- Caused CI/CD infrastructure failures
- 58,050 additions, 6,757 deletions indicate scope creep beyond intended task
- User explicitly requested rollback to restore dev branch stability

Files reverted:
- agentic-development/desktop-project-instructions/* (desktop workflow docs)
- agentic-development/branch-tracking/active-branches.json (tracking cleanup)
- package-lock.json (dependency sync restoration)

This restores dev branch to working state before failed PR #354 merge.

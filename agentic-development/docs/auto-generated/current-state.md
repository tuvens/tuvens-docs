- **Commit Message**: [Phase 1] Vibe Coder Core Identity Enhancement - System Orchestrator Implementation (#120)

* feat(vibe-coder): enhance identity with orchestration capabilities

Transform vibe-coder from experimental agent to System Orchestrator while 
maintaining creative approach. This is Phase 1 of orchestration system implementation.

Key enhancements:
- Add agent coordination and work validation responsibilities
- Establish mandatory agent check-in protocols
- Implement universal GitHub comment identity standards
- Maintain delegation-only approach (never implement directly)
- Keep creative system building strengths

This change is backward compatible and builds upon existing identity while
adding orchestration capabilities needed for multi-agent coordination.

Part of phased approach to implement comprehensive orchestration system
safely and with proper testing at each stage.

* docs(phase1): add comprehensive Phase 1 implementation documentation

Document the complete Phase 1 implementation of vibe-coder orchestration 
enhancements including objectives, changes, testing, and success metrics.

This documentation provides:
- Clear explanation of enhanced identity changes
- Testing and validation results
- Success metrics for immediate and future phases
- Integration details with existing system
- Preview of Phase 2 planning

Serves as both implementation record and foundation for remaining phases
of the orchestration system development.

* docs(phases): add comprehensive phased implementation tracking

Create master tracking document for all 5 phases of the vibe-coder 
orchestration system implementation. Documents the strategic breakdown
approach for safe, testable deployment.

Includes:
- Complete phase overview dashboard with status tracking
- Detailed objectives and success criteria for each phase
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- Phase transition criteria and approval processes
- Success metrics for overall project tracking

This replaces the monolithic PR #118 approach with a systematic,
phase-by-phase implementation that ensures quality and system stability.

* Fix Gemini Code Review issues in Phase 1 vibe-coder

- Fix validation script exit behavior for proper error handling
- Replace hardcoded path with TUVENS_ROOT environment variable
- Update documentation checkboxes to reflect completion status

Addresses all issues identified by Gemini Code Assist in PR #120

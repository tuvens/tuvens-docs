- **Current Branch**: dev

- **Commit Message**: Complete fix: Claude Desktop automation with shared library architecture (#242)

* fix: resolve critical path mismatch in desktop adapter

**Critical Bug Fix:**
- Desktop adapter was recalculating worktree paths instead of querying actual locations
- Core script creates worktree at real path, desktop adapter tried calculated path
- Mismatch caused `cd` failures and automation breakage

**Solution:**
- Desktop adapter now queries git for actual worktree location via `git worktree list`
- Eliminates path calculation synchronization issues
- Maintains portable path storage while using real paths for operations

**Technical Details:**
- Replaced path recalculation with `git worktree list | grep "\\[$BRANCH_NAME\\]"`
- Added fallback to expand portable paths from prompt file if needed
- Added validation to ensure worktree path is found before proceeding

**Test Results:**
‚úÖ Worktree path resolution works correctly
‚úÖ Desktop adapter can successfully change directories
‚úÖ End-to-end Claude Desktop automation functional

**Follow-up Required:**
Need to implement shared library to eliminate code duplication between scripts
(tracked separately per vibe coder architecture guidance)

Resolves critical automation failure identified by vibe coder agent.

* feat: implement shared library to eliminate code duplication and prevent sync bugs

**Architecture Fix:**
- Created comprehensive shared-functions.sh library
- Eliminated all duplicated logic between setup-agent-task.sh and setup-agent-task-desktop.sh
- Single source of truth prevents future synchronization bugs

**Shared Functions Implemented:**
- `make_path_portable()` / `expand_portable_path()` - Path format conversion
- `sanitize_for_branch()` / `calculate_branch_name()` - Branch name standardization
- `get_worktree_path()` - Query actual worktree locations from git
- `calculate_worktree_path()` - Standardized path calculation for creation
- `validate_required_tools()` / `validate_git_repo()` - Common validations
- `handle_script_error()` - Standardized error handling

**Code Deduplication Results:**
- ‚úÖ Agent name sanitization - now shared function
- ‚úÖ Branch name calculation - now shared function
- ‚úÖ Path formatting - now shared functions
- ‚úÖ Worktree path handling - now shared function
- ‚úÖ Error handling patterns - now shared function

**Bug Prevention:**
This architectural change prevents the entire class of synchronization bugs
that occurred during PR #238 review process, where path handling changes
were applied to one script but not synchronized with the other.

**Backward Compatibility:**
Both scripts maintain identical external behavior while using shared internals.

**Test Results:**
‚úÖ Round-trip path conversion successful
‚úÖ Branch name calculation matches previous logic
‚úÖ Worktree path resolution works with existing worktrees
‚úÖ Both scripts pass syntax validation

As recommended by vibe coder architectural guidance:
"Code deduplication prevents future sync bugs through proper design."

* fix: address Gemini Code Assist code review feedback on PR #242

HIGH SEVERITY FIXES:
- Fix unsafe array assignment in calculate_worktree_path() for paths with spaces
- Replace repo_info=($(get_repo_paths)) with temp file approach
- Modify get_repo_paths() to output each path on separate lines

MEDIUM SEVERITY IMPROVEMENTS:
- Use expand_portable_path() instead of manual path expansion logic
- Replace complex one-liner with explicit if/else for IS_TUVENS_DOCS
- Improve grep pattern in get_worktree_path() using -F flag and head -n1

These changes improve code safety, maintainability, and handle edge cases
with file paths containing spaces or special characters.

Addresses feedback from Gemini Code Assist on PR #242.

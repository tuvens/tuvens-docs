# Branch Protection Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan documents the implementation of comprehensive branch protection and collaborative code review workflows from the event-harvester repository to tuvens-docs and tuvens-mobile repositories.

**Status**: Ready for Implementation - Prerequisites Complete  
**Created**: 2025-08-08  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-15  
**Prerequisites**: ✅ Completed (Issue #42)

## Prerequisites Completed

Before implementing branch protection, the following foundational issues were resolved:

### ✅ Task 0A: Agent Documentation Consistency (Completed)
- Fixed `agentic-development/workflows/branching-strategy.md`
- Replaced non-existent agents (`docs-orchestrator`, `integration-specialist`, `backend-dev`, `frontend-dev`)
- Updated with actual agents: `codehooks-dev`, `devops`, `laravel-dev`, `mobile-dev`, `node-dev`, `react-dev`, `svelte-dev`, `vibe-coder`
- Updated all branch naming examples and worktree creation commands

### ✅ Task 0B: Central Branch Tracking Implementation (Completed)
- Created `agentic-development/branch-tracking/` directory structure
- Implemented JSON files: `active-branches.json`, `task-groups.json`, `merge-log.json`, `cleanup-queue.json`
- Created GitHub Actions workflow: `.github/workflows/branch-tracking.yml`
- Implemented tracking scripts: `update-branch-tracking.js`, `cleanup-merged-branches.sh`

### ✅ Task 0C: Repository State Cleanup (Completed)
- Cleaned up stale worktrees and prunable branches
- Documented current repository state in tracking system
- Established cleanup protocols and procedures

**Result**: Clean foundation ready for branch protection implementation with accurate agent assignments and comprehensive tracking system.

## Goal

Replicate the proven branch protection and code review automations from event-harvester to ensure:
1. No accidental breaking changes to protected branches
2. Mandatory code review processes
3. Automated safety validation before merges
4. Claude Code safety enforcement
5. Standardized pull request workflows

## Source Analysis: Event-Harvester Model

### ✅ What Event-Harvester Has (Working):

1. **Branch Protection Workflow** (`branch-protection.yml`)
   - Validates Claude Code safety infrastructure
   - Enforces 5-branch strategy: `main ← staging ← test ← develop ← feature/*`
   - Branch naming validation (feature/, fix/, docs/ patterns)
   - Safety documentation requirements

2. **Pre-Merge Safety Script** (`check-before-merge-to-develop.sh`)
   - Mandatory checklist before merging
   - Conflict detection and recent commits review
   - Prevents accidental overwrites

3. **Claude Code Integration**
   - Comprehensive CLAUDE.md with safety rules
   - Custom `/resolve-issue` command
   - Testing protocols enforcement

4. **Documentation Enforcement**
   - Validates existence of required safety docs
   - Checks for mandatory safety sections
   - Environment detection validation

### ❌ What tuvens-docs is Missing:

1. No GitHub branch protection rules
2. No validation workflows for safety
3. No branch naming enforcement
4. No pre-merge safety scripts
5. No CODEOWNERS file
6. No PR templates
7. Incomplete Claude safety enforcement
8. No mandatory pre-steps validation

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Documentation and Planning
- Document overall strategy (this file)
- Break down into discrete tasks
- Create task-specific documentation
- Set up GitHub issues for tracking

### Phase 2: Safety Infrastructure
- Adapt CLAUDE.md safety rules
- Create branch protection workflow
- Add pre-merge safety scripts
- Set up mandatory documentation checks

### Phase 3: Pull Request Workflows
- Create PR templates
- Add CODEOWNERS file
- Set up automated reviewer assignment
- Implement status checks

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation
- Test on tuvens-docs first
- Validate all workflows work correctly
- Document any customizations needed
- Create rollout plan for tuvens-mobile

### Phase 5: Production Rollout
- Apply to tuvens-docs main branches
- Monitor for any issues
- Adapt for tuvens-mobile
- Document lessons learned

## Task Breakdown

Each task will be handled in a separate Claude session with its own worktree and GitHub issue:

1. **Task 1: Adapt CLAUDE.md Safety Rules**
   - Agent: vibe-coder
   - Worktree: `vibe-coder/task-01-claude-safety-rules`
   - Deliverable: Enhanced CLAUDE.md with tuvens-docs specific safety rules

2. **Task 2: Create Branch Protection Workflow**
   - Agent: devops
   - Worktree: `devops/task-02-branch-protection-workflow`
   - Deliverable: `.github/workflows/branch-protection.yml`

3. **Task 3: Pre-Merge Safety Scripts**
   - Agent: devops
   - Worktree: `devops/task-03-pre-merge-safety`
   - Deliverable: Safety scripts and validation tools

4. **Task 4: Pull Request Templates**
   - Agent: vibe-coder
   - Worktree: `vibe-coder/task-04-pr-templates`
   - Deliverable: PR templates and CODEOWNERS

5. **Task 5: Testing and Validation**
   - Agent: node-dev
   - Worktree: `node-dev/task-05-testing-validation`
   - Deliverable: Validation results and fixes

6. **Task 6: tuvens-mobile Adaptation**
   - Agent: mobile-dev
   - Worktree: `mobile-dev/task-06-mobile-adaptation`
   - Deliverable: Mobile-specific customizations

## Safety Considerations

### No Breaking Changes Policy
- All work done on separate branches
- No modifications to existing workflows without explicit permission
- Clear justification required for any changes
- Rollback plan for each component

### Validation Requirements
- Each task must be tested in isolation
- Integration testing before production rollout
- Documentation of all changes and rationale
- User approval for workflow modifications

### Session Management
- Each task uses `/start-session` with appropriate agent
- Proper worktree organization following established patterns
- GitHub issues for tracking and coordination
- Clear handoffs between sessions

## Success Criteria

### For tuvens-docs:
- [ ] Branch protection rules active on main/dev/test/stage
- [ ] Pre-merge safety validation working
- [ ] Claude Code safety rules enforced
- [ ] PR templates and CODEOWNERS implemented
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing workflows
- [ ] All agents can work safely within the system

### For tuvens-mobile:
- [ ] All tuvens-docs protections adapted
- [ ] Mobile-specific customizations implemented
- [ ] Flutter development workflows integrated
- [ ] Testing and deployment safety maintained

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Areas:
1. **Existing Workflows**: Careful not to break notify-repositories.yml or vibe-coder-maintenance.yml
2. **Branch Names**: Ensure compatibility with existing branch naming
3. **Agent Workflows**: Don't disrupt established agent workflow patterns

### Mitigation Strategies:
1. **Separate Branch Development**: All work on docs/task-specific branches
2. **Documentation First**: Comprehensive documentation before implementation
3. **Incremental Testing**: Test each component individually
4. **User Approval Gates**: No deployment without explicit permission

## Timeline Estimates

- **Phase 1 (Documentation)**: 1 session (current)
- **Phase 2 (Safety Infrastructure)**: 2-3 sessions
- **Phase 3 (PR Workflows)**: 2 sessions  
- **Phase 4 (Testing)**: 2 sessions
- **Phase 5 (Production)**: 1-2 sessions

**Total Estimated Sessions**: 8-11 focused Claude sessions

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Complete task breakdown documentation
2. ✅ Prerequisites completed (agent documentation consistency, central branch tracking, repository cleanup)
3. Create GitHub issues for each task
4. Start Task 1: Adapt CLAUDE.md Safety Rules
5. Use `/start-session vibe-coder` for focused work

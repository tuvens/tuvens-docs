# Technical Quality Principles: D/E, R/R, C/C

## Core Quality Principles

### D/E Principle: Demonstration-over-Explanation
**The D/E Principle (Demonstration-over-Explanation)** requires that agents PROVE their claims with evidence rather than simply explaining them. Every assertion must be backed by demonstrable evidence, ensuring accountability and preventing unsubstantiated claims.

### R/R Principle: Recognition-over-Recall  
**The R/R Principle (Recognition-over-Recall)** adapted from Jakob Nielsen's UX heuristic reduces cognitive overhead by organizing files, folders, and code into appropriate, recognizable structures. This eliminates loose files and redundant directories while applying recognition principles to code organization.

### C/C Principle: Convention-over-Configuration
**The C/C Principle (Convention-over-Configuration)** ensures code follows established project and framework patterns rather than inventing custom solutions. Technical QA is responsible for quality control on pattern consistency and convention compliance.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Evidence-Based Validation
- **Show actual proof** of completeness (test results, coverage reports, working demos)
- **Provide evidence** before making claims about functionality
- **Demonstrate** features work with executable examples
- **Document** with screenshots, logs, or test output as proof

### 2. Zero Unsubstantiated Claims
- **NO assertions without evidence** - every claim must be backed by proof
- **No "trust me" statements** - everything must be verifiable
- **Measurable outcomes** - use metrics, percentages, and concrete data
- **Reproducible results** - evidence must be repeatable by others

### 3. Comprehensive Documentation
- **Before/after comparisons** showing actual improvements
- **Step-by-step validation** with command outputs
- **Visual proof** through screenshots where applicable
- **Quantified results** with specific numbers and measurements

## Implementation Examples

### D/E Principle Examples

#### ❌ WRONG: Explanation Without Evidence
```
"The tests pass and coverage is good."
"The feature works correctly."
"Performance has been improved."
"The code is now more maintainable."
```

#### ✅ RIGHT: Demonstration With Evidence
```bash
# Test Results Evidence
$ npm test
✓ All 47 tests passed (2.3s)
✓ 0 failing tests
✓ 0 skipped tests

# Coverage Evidence  
$ npm run test:coverage
Lines      : 92.5% (185/200)
Functions  : 95.2% (40/42)
Branches   : 88.9% (24/27)
Statements : 92.5% (185/200)

# Feature Functionality Evidence
$ curl -X POST /api/users -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name":"test","email":"test@example.com"}'
{
  "id": 123,
  "name": "test", 
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "created_at": "2025-08-26T14:30:00Z",
  "status": "active"
}

# Performance Improvement Evidence
Before optimization:
  Average response time: 2.4s
  Memory usage: 512MB
  
After optimization:  
  Average response time: 0.8s (-66.7% improvement)
  Memory usage: 256MB (-50% improvement)
  
Evidence: ab -n 1000 -c 10 results attached
```

### R/R Principle Examples

#### ❌ WRONG: Poor File/Folder Organization
```
src/
├── component1.js (loose file)
├── util.js (loose file)  
├── helpers/ (redundant with utils/)
│   └── format.js
├── utils/
│   └── validation.js
└── temp_components/ (unclear purpose)
    └── NewFeature.js
```

#### ✅ RIGHT: Recognition-Based Structure
```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── Component1/
│   │   ├── index.js
│   │   └── Component1.test.js
│   └── index.js (barrel export)
├── utils/
│   ├── format.js
│   ├── validation.js
│   └── index.js
└── features/
    └── NewFeature/
        ├── components/
        ├── hooks/
        └── index.js

Evidence: Directory structure follows established patterns,
no loose files, clear categorization, intuitive navigation
```

### C/C Principle Examples

#### ❌ WRONG: Custom Patterns Over Conventions
```javascript
// Custom routing pattern instead of framework convention
class CustomRouter {
  addCustomRoute(path, handler) {
    this.customRoutes[path] = handler;
  }
}

// Custom state management instead of Redux/Zustand patterns
const customStateManager = {
  updateCustomState: (stateName, value) => {
    customGlobalState[stateName] = value;
    customNotifyAll();
  }
};
```

#### ✅ RIGHT: Framework Convention Compliance  
```javascript
// Following Express.js conventions
app.get('/api/users', userController.getUsers);
app.post('/api/users', userController.createUser);

// Following Redux Toolkit conventions
const userSlice = createSlice({
  name: 'user',
  initialState,
  reducers: {
    setUser: (state, action) => {
      state.user = action.payload;
    }
  }
});

Evidence: Code follows established framework patterns,
uses conventional API structure, matches project conventions
```

## Quality Assurance Application

### Code Review Standards
When reviewing code, QA agents must validate all principles:

1. **D/E: Test Coverage Validation**
   ```bash
   # Generate and show coverage report
   jest --coverage --coverageReporters=text-lcov
   # Show specific percentages and missing coverage areas
   ```

2. **D/E: Functionality Demonstration**
   ```bash
   # Execute the feature and capture output
   node examples/feature-demo.js
   # Show actual working examples, not descriptions
   ```

3. **R/R: File/Folder Structure Analysis**
   ```bash
   # Document directory structure
   tree src/ -I 'node_modules|dist'
   # Identify loose files and redundant directories
   find . -maxdepth 2 -type f -name "*.js" | grep -v "src/"
   ```

4. **C/C: Convention Compliance Validation**
   ```bash
   # Check framework pattern compliance
   eslint --rule "import/no-relative-parent-imports: error"
   # Validate naming conventions
   find src/ -name "*.js" | grep -v "[A-Z][a-z]*\.js$"
   ```

5. **D/E: Performance Verification**
   ```bash
   # Run benchmarks and show results
   npm run benchmark
   # Provide before/after metrics with evidence
   ```

6. **D/E: Security Validation**
   ```bash
   # Run security scans and show clean results
   npm audit --audit-level=moderate
   # Show specific vulnerabilities addressed (if any)
   ```

### Technical Debt Assessment
When assessing technical debt:

1. **Identify Specific Issues**
   - File:line references for each problem
   - Exact code snippets showing the issue
   - Quantified impact (maintenance time, bug frequency)

2. **Measure Improvement Impact**
   - Before/after complexity metrics
   - Reduction in code duplication percentages
   - Performance improvements with benchmarks

3. **Validate Refactoring Success**
   - All tests still pass (show test results)
   - No functionality regression (demonstrate equivalence)
   - Measurable code quality improvements

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Vague Quality Claims
```
❌ "The code quality has improved"
✅ "Cyclomatic complexity reduced from 15 to 8 (47% improvement)"
    "Code duplication reduced from 23% to 4% (evidence: SonarQube report attached)"
```

### 2. Untested Functionality Claims
```
❌ "The API endpoint works correctly"
✅ "API endpoint tested with 15 different scenarios:
    - Valid requests: 12/12 passed ✓
    - Invalid requests: 3/3 properly rejected ✓
    - Edge cases: 8/8 handled correctly ✓
    Evidence: Postman collection results attached"
```

### 3. Unsubstantiated Performance Claims
```
❌ "Performance is much better now"
✅ "Load test results show 40% response time improvement:
    - 95th percentile: 1.2s → 0.7s
    - Throughput: 1000 req/s → 1400 req/s
    - Memory usage: 2GB → 1.4GB
    Evidence: Load test reports attached"
```

## Tools for Evidence Generation

### Testing Evidence
- **Unit Tests**: Jest, pytest, PHPUnit, go test
- **Integration Tests**: Supertest, Postman collections, Cypress
- **Coverage Reports**: Istanbul, Coverage.py, SimpleCov
- **Load Testing**: Artillery, JMeter, ab (Apache Bench)

### Code Quality Evidence
- **Static Analysis**: ESLint, SonarQube, CodeClimate
- **Security Scanning**: npm audit, safety, gosec
- **Dependency Analysis**: npm outdated, pip-check, go mod verify

- **Metrics Dashboards**: Grafana/DataDog showing performance improvements
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger with working examples

## Enforcement in Code Reviews

### QA Agent Checklist
For every code review, verify:

- [ ] **All claims backed by evidence** - No unsubstantiated statements
- [ ] **Test results shown** - Not just "tests pass" but actual output
- [ ] **Coverage numbers provided** - Specific percentages with reports
- [ ] **Working examples demonstrated** - Not just code, but execution proof
- [ ] **Performance measured** - Benchmarks for any performance-related changes
- [ ] **Security validated** - Scan results for security-sensitive changes
- [ ] **Documentation updated** - Evidence that docs match implementation

### Review Comment Standards
All review comments must include:
1. **Specific file:line references** for issues identified
2. **Evidence of the problem** (error messages, test failures, metrics)
3. **Proof of proposed solution** (working code, passing tests, measurements)
4. **Verification steps** for the reviewer to reproduce results

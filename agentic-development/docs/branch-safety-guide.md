- **Process Failure**: Safety scripts malfunction, blocking valid work
- **Time-Critical Situations**: External deadlines, emergency releases

#### Generate Emergency Override Token
```bash
./agentic-development/scripts/github-mcp-protection.sh --emergency "production hotfix required"

# Output:
🚨 EMERGENCY OVERRIDE GENERATED
   Token: EMERGENCY_1692041234_a1b2c3d4
   Reason: production hotfix required
   Branch: main
   Timestamp: 2025-08-14T14:30:22-07:00

⚠️  IMPORTANT WARNINGS:
   • Override bypasses all MCP protections
   • Use only for genuine emergencies
   • Document usage in incident report
   • Report to vibe-coder system orchestrator
```

#### Use Emergency Override
```bash
# Activate override (temporary)
export MCP_EMERGENCY_OVERRIDE="EMERGENCY_1692041234_a1b2c3d4"

# Perform emergency operation
git add .
git commit -m "Emergency hotfix: critical production issue"

# Deactivate override immediately after use
unset MCP_EMERGENCY_OVERRIDE
```

#### Step 3: Mobile-Specific Actions ⚡
- [ ] **Review Mobile Standards**: Check mobile-relevant sections in `shared-protocols/`
- [ ] **Check Authentication Updates**: Review `implementation-guides/cross-app-authentication/README.md`
- [ ] **Verify Design System Compliance**: 
  - Colors: Tuvens Blue (#5C69E6), Coral (#FF5A6D), Yellow (#FFD669), Navy (#071551)
  - Typography: System fonts for mobile (SF Pro, Roboto)
  - Mobile-responsive patterns and touch interfaces
- [ ] **Update Non-Compliant Components**: Fix any components not following new standards
- [ ] **Review Location Services**: Check any geo-fencing and location-based feature updates

#### Step 4: Compliance Verification
```bash
# Run mobile development checks
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm test -- --coverage

# Verify coverage meets 70% requirement (mobile-adjusted)
echo "Coverage should be ≥70%"

# Check for Tuvens design system usage in mobile
grep -r "primary\|secondary\|accent" src/styles/ || echo "Design system in use"

# Test mobile-specific functionality
npm run test:ios     # If iOS tests available
npm run test:android # If Android tests available
```

#### Step 5: Platform Testing (If Applicable)
```bash
# Test React Native functionality (if applicable)
npx react-native doctor
npx react-native run-ios --simulator="iPhone 14"
npx react-native run-android

# Test Flutter functionality (if applicable) 
flutter doctor
flutter test
flutter build apk --debug

# Verify cross-app authentication works
# Test location-based features
```

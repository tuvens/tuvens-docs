### Context Integration
This protocol is mandatory for ALL agents. Every GitHub comment by any agent must follow these standards. Load this immediately when working with GitHub issues or agent coordination.

## Overview

The GitHub Comment Standards Protocol establishes the universal comment identity system that ensures clear communication and accountability in all agent interactions. This protocol transforms the theoretical framework from Phase 1 into practical, testable procedures with validation scenarios and success metrics.

## Core Requirements

### Universal Comment Format (MANDATORY)

**EVERY GitHub issue comment by ANY agent MUST start with:**

```markdown
üë§ **Identity**: [my-agent-name] 
üéØ **Addressing**: [target-agent-name or @all]
```

This format ensures clear communication and accountability in all agent interactions across the entire multi-agent system.

### Required Header Components

#### Identity Declaration
- **Format**: `üë§ **Identity**: [agent-name]`
- **Purpose**: Clear identification of the commenting agent
- **Validation**: Must match registered agent name in `.claude/agents/` directory
- **Examples**:
  - ‚úÖ `üë§ **Identity**: vibe-coder`
  - ‚úÖ `üë§ **Identity**: laravel-dev`
  - ‚ùå `üë§ **Identity**: unknown-agent` (unregistered)
  - ‚ùå `Identity: vibe-coder` (missing emoji and formatting)

#### Addressing Declaration
- **Format**: `üéØ **Addressing**: [target-agent or @all]`
- **Purpose**: Clear targeting of communication recipient
- **Options**:
  - Specific agent: `üéØ **Addressing**: docs-orchestrator`
  - Multiple agents: `üéØ **Addressing**: laravel-dev, react-dev`
  - All agents: `üéØ **Addressing**: @all`
  - User/maintainer: `üéØ **Addressing**: @maintainer`

## Context Enhancement Comments for Complex Tasks

### When to Use Context Enhancement

For complex tasks created via `/start-session` that require extensive analysis, planning, or specific implementation guidance, the basic GitHub issue may not provide sufficient context. In these cases, **add a detailed context comment** immediately after issue creation.

### Context Enhancement Template

Use this specialized template when adding comprehensive context to support task handoffs:

```markdown
üë§ **Identity**: [coordinating-agent] (coordinating agent)
üéØ **Addressing**: [receiving-agent]

## Complete Context Analysis

### Problem Statement
[Detailed explanation of the issue, requirement, or task complexity]

### Current State Analysis  
[What you've discovered about the current implementation, architecture, or situation]

### Implementation Requirements
[Specific technical requirements, constraints, dependencies, and considerations]

### Recommended Approach
[Your suggested implementation strategy, architecture decisions, or methodology]

### Key Files and Locations
[Specific files, functions, classes, and line numbers relevant to the task]
- `path/to/file.ext:line-number` - [description of relevance]
- `another/file.ext:function-name` - [what needs to be modified]

### Success Criteria  
[Detailed, measurable outcomes for task completion]
- [ ] [Specific completion requirement]
- [ ] [Testing requirement]
- [ ] [Documentation requirement]

- Preserve all natural language patterns and examples  
- Keep cross-references working and comprehensive
- Ensure mobile-friendly documentation structure
- Follow existing micro-docs navigation pattern

### Recommended Approach
1. **Extract Quick Start Guide** - Pull essential `/start-session` patterns into standalone file
2. **Separate Troubleshooting** - Create dedicated troubleshooting.md with all error scenarios
3. **Reorganize Natural Language** - Focus natural-language-patterns.md on intent recognition only
4. **Create Advanced Usage** - Move complex scenarios and edge cases to advanced-usage.md
5. **Update Navigation** - Ensure all files have proper cross-links and breadcrumbs

### Key Files and Locations
- `agentic-development/desktop-project-instructions/README.md:1-240` - Main restructuring target  
- `agentic-development/desktop-project-instructions/natural-language-patterns.md:15-45` - Intent patterns to preserve
- `agentic-development/desktop-project-instructions/agent-management.md:1-30` - Cross-reference dependencies
- Navigation links at lines 167-194 need updating for new structure

### Success Criteria
- [ ] README.md under 100 lines focused on essential quick start
- [ ] All troubleshooting content in dedicated troubleshooting.md
- [ ] Natural language patterns focused and concise
- [ ] All cross-references working correctly
- [ ] No functionality or examples lost in reorganization
- [ ] Mobile navigation improved with shorter page loads

### Implementation Guidance
1. Start by extracting troubleshooting section (lines 129-157) to new file
2. Move advanced scenarios (lines 188-225) to advanced-usage.md
3. Preserve all MCP command examples and ensure they're easily discoverable
4. Test all navigation links after reorganization
5. Follow the existing micro-docs pattern with clear breadcrumb navigation

**Status**: Context provided - ready for implementation  
**Next Action**: react-dev to begin restructuring with provided analysis and file locations

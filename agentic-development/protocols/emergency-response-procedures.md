# Emergency Response Procedures Protocol

**Protocol**: Crisis Management and Violation Response System  
**Version**: 1.0  
**Created**: 2025-08-14  
**Phase**: 2 Implementation  

## Overview

The Emergency Response Procedures Protocol establishes a comprehensive crisis management framework for handling violations, system emergencies, and critical incidents within the multi-agent system. This protocol transforms theoretical emergency response concepts into practical, testable procedures with clear escalation paths, response time targets, and recovery protocols.

## Emergency Classification System

### 4-Level Emergency Classification

#### Level 1: Minor Violations (Info)
**Characteristics**:
- Protocol compliance issues that don't impact operations
- Minor formatting or procedural violations
- Missing non-critical information

**Examples**:
- Agent comment missing status field
- Incomplete task description
- Minor branch naming convention deviation

**Response Time**: 5-10 minutes  
**Escalation**: None  
**Resolution**: Automated correction request  

#### Level 2: Moderate Violations (Warning)
**Characteristics**:
- Protocol violations that could impact system coordination
- Work proceeding without proper authorization
- Resource conflicts requiring intervention

**Examples**:
- Agent working without check-in validation
- File scope conflicts detected
- Unauthorized access to protected directories

**Response Time**: 2-5 minutes  
**Escalation**: Vibe-coder notification  
**Resolution**: Work suspension pending compliance  

#### Level 3: Severe Violations (Critical)
**Characteristics**:
- Violations that threaten system integrity or security
- Repeated non-compliance after warnings
- Actions that could cause system-wide disruption

**Examples**:
- Attempting to work on protected branches
- Ignoring multiple correction requests
- Security boundary violations

**Response Time**: 30 seconds - 2 minutes  
**Escalation**: Immediate vibe-coder intervention  
**Resolution**: Agent lockout, manual review required  

#### Level 4: Emergency Crisis (Alert)
**Characteristics**:
- Immediate threat to system security or stability
- Potential data loss or corruption risks
- Critical infrastructure failures

**Examples**:
- Production system compromise attempts
- Mass violation patterns indicating system attack
- Critical dependency failures affecting all agents

**Response Time**: Immediate (0-30 seconds)  
**Escalation**: Full emergency response team activation  
**Resolution**: System lockdown, emergency procedures  

## Response Time Targets

### Detection Requirements

| Emergency Level | Detection Time | Response Time | Resolution Target |
|-----------------|----------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Level 1 | 5 minutes | 10 minutes | 30 minutes |
| Level 2 | 2 minutes | 5 minutes | 15 minutes |
| Level 3 | 30 seconds | 2 minutes | 10 minutes |
| Level 4 | Immediate | 30 seconds | 5 minutes |

### Response Time Measurement
- **Detection Time**: From violation occurrence to system detection
- **Response Time**: From detection to initial response action
- **Resolution Time**: From response to full issue resolution
- **Total Time**: Complete incident lifecycle duration

- Emergency status prevents new session starts
- Recovery procedures require clean check-in validation

### GitHub Comment Standards
- All emergency communications use standard format
- Emergency alerts follow addressing protocols
- Incident documentation maintains consistent formatting

### File Scope Management
- Emergency lockdowns suspend all file reservations
- Critical incidents may require scope conflict emergency resolution
- Recovery procedures include file access restoration

## Troubleshooting Emergency Response

### Common Response Issues

#### Delayed Detection
**Issue**: Violations not detected within target time  
**Solution**: Improve automated monitoring systems  
**Prevention**: Enhanced real-time scanning and alerting  

#### Agent Non-Response
**Issue**: Agents not responding to emergency notices  
**Solution**: Automatic escalation and alternative contact methods  
**Prevention**: Multiple communication channels and mandatory response training  

#### False Positives
**Issue**: Emergency responses triggered by non-emergencies  
**Solution**: Refine detection algorithms and validation procedures  
**Prevention**: Better pattern recognition and manual verification steps  

#### Recovery Delays
**Issue**: Incident resolution taking longer than targets  
**Solution**: Streamline recovery procedures and decision processes  
**Prevention**: Better preparation and automated recovery tools

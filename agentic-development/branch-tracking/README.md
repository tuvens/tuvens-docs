## üìö When to Load This Document

### Primary Context Loading Scenarios
- **Session Coordination**: Before starting any agent session to check active work
- **Branch Creation**: When creating new feature branches to avoid conflicts
- **Task Handoffs**: When transferring work between agents or completing tasks
- **Cleanup Operations**: When branches are merged and worktrees need cleanup
- **System Status Checks**: When investigating coordination issues or system state

### Dependency Mapping
**Load Before:**
- [../workflows/central-branch-tracking.md](../workflows/central-branch-tracking.md) - Workflow implementation details
- [../scripts/update-branch-tracking.js](../scripts/update-branch-tracking.js) - Update script usage

**Load With:**
- [active-branches.json](./active-branches.json) - Current system state
- [task-groups.json](./task-groups.json) - Related branch groups
- [agent-sessions.json](./agent-sessions.json) - Active agent work

**Load After:**
- [cleanup-queue.json](./cleanup-queue.json) - Branches ready for cleanup
- [merge-log.json](./merge-log.json) - Recent merge history

### Context Integration
This system provides real-time coordination state across all repositories. Load when you need to understand what agents are working on and how to coordinate new work without conflicts.

This directory contains the implementation of the Central Branch Tracking System for coordinating multi-agent development across the Tuvens ecosystem.

## Files

### Data Files
- **`active-branches.json`** - Current active branches across all repositories
- **`task-groups.json`** - Related branches working on same features/tasks
- **`merge-log.json`** - Recently merged branches with metadata
- **`cleanup-queue.json`** - Branches ready for worktree cleanup

### Update Script
- **`../scripts/update-branch-tracking.js`** - Node.js script that updates tracking data

## Usage

### View Current Status
```bash
# View active branches
cat active-branches.json | jq '.branches'

# View task groups
cat task-groups.json | jq 'keys'

# View cleanup queue
cat cleanup-queue.json | jq '.eligibleForCleanup'
```

### Manual Updates
```bash
# Add new branch
node ../scripts/update-branch-tracking.js \
  --action=create \
  --repository=tuvens-docs \
  --branch=vibe-coder/new-feature \
  --agent=vibe-coder \
  --worktree=/path/to/worktree

# Record merge
node ../scripts/update-branch-tracking.js \
  --action=merge \
  --repository=tuvens-docs \
  --branch=vibe-coder/new-feature \
  --target-branch=dev \
  --merged-by=ciarancarroll
```

### GitHub Integration
The system is designed to work with GitHub Actions webhooks. See the main documentation in `../workflows/central-branch-tracking.md` for full integration details.

## Data Structure

### Active Branches
Each active branch entry contains:
- Branch name and repository
- Author and creation timestamp
- Current status and last activity
- Associated task group (if any)
- Agent responsible
- Related branches in other repositories
- GitHub URLs and issue references
- Local worktree path

### Task Groups
Task groups coordinate related work across repositories:
- Group title and description
- Coordinator and creation date
- Current status
- Branch assignments per repository
- Agent assignments and responsibilities
- Dependencies between branches
- Associated issues and documentation

### Merge Log
Tracks completed work for reporting and cleanup:
- Merge metadata (when, who, target branch)
- Task group association
- Cleanup eligibility status
- Worktree path for cleanup

## Integration with Workflows

This system integrates with:
- `/start-session` command for checking related work
- `setup-agent-task.sh` for registering new branches
- GitHub Actions for automated updates
- Cleanup scripts for worktree management

## Status

‚úÖ **Data Structure**: Core JSON files created and initialized  
‚úÖ **Update Script**: Node.js script for manual and automated updates  
‚è≥ **GitHub Integration**: Webhook handlers need to be deployed  
‚è≥ **Local Commands**: Enhanced /start-session integration needed  
‚è≥ **Cleanup Automation**: Cleanup scripts need enhancement  

This implementation provides the foundation for coordinated multi-agent development with proper branch lifecycle tracking.

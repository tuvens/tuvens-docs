# Multi-Agent Authentication Coordination

## Overview
This document coordinates work between Frontend and Backend Developer agents for authentication implementation.

## Active Agents

### Frontend Developer Agent (tuvens-client)
- **Window**: iTerm2 session at `/Code/tuvens/tuvens-client`
- **Task**: Analyze authentication UI components
- **Status**: Ready for Claude Code session
- **Context**: Load Frontend Developer identity from agent-identities.md

### Backend Developer Agent (tuvens-api)  
- **Window**: iTerm2 session at `/Code/tuvens/tuvens-api`
- **Task**: Review authentication API endpoints
- **Status**: Ready for Claude Code session
- **Context**: Load Backend Developer identity from agent-identities.md

## Coordination Tasks

### Phase 1: Analysis (Both Agents)
**Frontend Agent Tasks:**
- [ ] Analyze existing authentication UI components
- [ ] Document current authentication user flows
- [ ] Identify missing UI elements for OAuth2 flow
- [ ] Report findings in pending-commits/main/

**Backend Agent Tasks:**
- [ ] Review existing authentication API endpoints
- [ ] Document current authentication middleware
- [ ] Identify gaps in OAuth2 implementation
- [ ] Report findings in pending-commits/main/

### Phase 2: Planning (Coordination Required)
- [ ] Compare frontend and backend findings
- [ ] Align on authentication flow architecture
- [ ] Define API contracts between frontend/backend
- [ ] Create implementation plan with dependencies

### Phase 3: Implementation (Parallel Work)
- [ ] Frontend: Implement OAuth2 UI components
- [ ] Backend: Implement OAuth2 API endpoints
- [ ] Integration: Connect frontend to backend APIs
- [ ] Testing: Coordinate end-to-end testing

## Communication Protocol

### Status Updates
Both agents should update their progress in:
- `agentic-development/pending-commits/main/YYYY-MM-DD-main-{agent}-{description}.md`

### Handoff Points
When work needs coordination:
1. Document current state in pending-commits/
2. Create specific coordination notes in this file
3. Update workflow status
4. Hand off to appropriate agent

### Conflict Resolution
If agents discover conflicting requirements:
1. Document the conflict in this file
2. Escalate to Documentation Orchestrator
3. Wait for resolution before proceeding

## Current Status: Ready for Multi-Agent Testing

Both iTerm2 windows have been created and are ready for Claude Code sessions. Agents can start their analysis tasks immediately.

## Testing Notes

This is an experimental test of:
- Multi-window agent coordination
- Parallel agent execution
- Cross-repository communication
- Workflow handoff protocols

Results and learnings should be documented in pending-commits/ for future reference.

**Next Actions:**
1. Start Claude Code in Frontend Agent window
2. Start Claude Code in Backend Agent window  
3. Begin Phase 1 analysis tasks
4. Document findings and coordinate in Phase 2

# Agent Terminal Prompts

**[CODE] - Task-specific prompt templates for Claude Code sessions**

## Overview

This document provides copy-paste ready prompts for each agent type when starting Claude Code sessions. These prompts ensure consistent agent identity loading and task execution.

## Vibe Coder Agent Prompt

### For Feature: Agent Workflow Instructions

```
I am the Vibe Coder - experimental agent for creative system building.

Context Loading:

## Usage Instructions

### For Creating Agent Windows

When creating an agent window with iTerm2, include the full prompt in the window setup:

```bash
osascript -e 'tell application "iTerm2"
    create window with default profile
    tell current session of current window
        set name to "ðŸŽ¨ Vibe Coder - feature-agent-workflow"
        write text "cd ~/Code/Tuvens/worktrees/tuvens-docs/vibe-coder/feature-agent-workflow-instructions"
        write text "clear"
        write text "echo \"======================================\""
        write text "echo \"VIBE CODER AGENT - WORKFLOW INSTRUCTIONS\""
        write text "echo \"======================================\""
        write text "echo \"\""
        write text "echo \"INSTRUCTIONS:\""
        write text "echo \"1. Start Claude Code by typing: claude\""
        write text "echo \"2. Copy and paste this entire prompt:\""
        write text "echo \"\""
        write text "cat << '\''EOF'\''\""
        write text "I am the Vibe Coder - experimental agent for creative system building."
        write text ""
        write text "Context Loading:"
        write text "- Load: ~/Code/Tuvens/tuvens-docs/.claude/agents/vibe-coder.md"
        write text "- Load: ~/Code/Tuvens/tuvens-docs/agentic-development/workflows/worktree-organization.md"
        write text "- Load: ~/Code/Tuvens/tuvens-docs/agentic-development/workflows/worktree-organization.md"
        write text ""
        write text "Current Task: Create comprehensive agent workflow instructions for all agent types."
        write text ""
        write text "Specific Goals:"
        write text "1. Create workflow files for each agent type"
        write text "2. Follow the 6-step pattern from orchestrator workflow"
        write text "3. Include practical examples and commands"
        write text "4. Update pending-commits with progress"
        write text ""
        write text "Working Directory: $(pwd)"
        write text "Branch: vibe-coder/feature-agent-workflow-instructions"
        write text "EOF"
        write text "echo \"\""
        write text "echo \"======================================\""
    end tell
end tell'
```

### Best Practices

1. **Always Include Full Context**: Don't assume the agent will remember to load context
2. **Specify Working Directory**: Make the location explicit in the prompt
3. **List Specific Goals**: Clear, actionable goals prevent agent confusion
4. **Reference Documentation**: Point to specific files that need to be loaded
5. **Include Branch Information**: Help the agent understand their working context

This ensures every agent session starts with proper identity, context, and clear objectives.

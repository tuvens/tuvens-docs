## Key Principles

All Tuvens repositories must follow:
- ✅ Standard directory structure with Claude Code integration
- ✅ Consistent branching and commit standards
- ✅ Required CI/CD pipeline configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive testing and security requirements
- ✅ Proper monitoring and observability setup
- ✅ Cross-repository communication protocols

## Agent Usage

This documentation is primarily used by:
- **All agents** when setting up new repositories
- **DevOps agent** for CI/CD and infrastructure work
- **Development agents** for code quality and testing standards
- **Vibe Coder** for system improvements and process refinements

# Workflows

## Overview

This directory contains priority workflows and implementation guides for the Tuvens agentic development system.

## Available Workflows

### authentication-priority.md
High-priority workflow for implementing cross-application authentication:
- OAuth2 flow implementation
- Session management
- User synchronization
- Token handling and refresh

## Workflow Standards

All workflows follow these principles:
1. **Priority-based**: Tasks are ordered by business importance
2. **Agent-coordinated**: Multiple agents may contribute to a workflow
3. **Status-tracked**: Implementation status is maintained
4. **Documentation-driven**: All decisions are documented

## Workflow Execution

1. Load the relevant workflow document
2. Identify responsible agents (see agent-identities.md)
3. Follow the defined phases and tasks
4. Update status as work progresses
5. Coordinate with other agents as needed

## Adding New Workflows

When creating new workflows:
1. Define clear phases and tasks
2. Identify responsible agents
3. Include status tracking
4. Reference related documentation
5. Update this README

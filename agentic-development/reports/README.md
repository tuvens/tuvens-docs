# Implementation Reports

## Overview

This directory contains completed implementation reports for major agentic development system changes. Unlike `pending-commits/` which tracks work in progress, these reports document finished implementations and lessons learned.

## File Naming Convention

Use the format: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name-report.md`

Examples:
- `2025-07-30-workflow-foundation-implementation-report.md`
- `2025-07-31-multi-agent-coordination-report.md`
- `2025-08-01-integration-testing-report.md`

## Purpose

These reports serve to:
- Document complete implementations and their outcomes
- Capture lessons learned for future sessions
- Provide historical context for system evolution
- Share knowledge across different agent sessions
- Track successful patterns and approaches

## Relationship to Pending Commits

- **pending-commits/**: Work in progress, organized by branch
- **reports/**: Completed work, organized chronologically
- **workflows/**: Ongoing process documentation

## Report Standards

Each report should include:
- Executive summary of what was accomplished
- Complete challenge documentation (even minor issues)
- Solutions implemented and their effectiveness
- Lessons learned and recommendations
- Impact assessment and next steps
- File inventory of what was created/modified

This ensures comprehensive knowledge capture for the multi-agent development system.

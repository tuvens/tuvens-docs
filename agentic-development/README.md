# Agentic Development System

## Overview

The Agentic Development System is Tuvens' multi-agent approach to software development, enabling coordinated development across multiple repositories and services.

## Directory Structure

### agent-system/
Core documentation for the multi-agent system:
- Agent identities and roles
- Context loading procedures
- Repository ecosystem overview

### integration-guides/
Detailed guides for integrating with external services:
- hi-events integration documentation
- API specifications and requirements
- Authentication flows and testing guides

### claude-templates/
Claude Code command templates and integration protocols:
- Custom commands for common workflows
- Integration registry
- Collaboration protocols

### workflows/
Priority workflows and implementation guides:
- Authentication priority workflow
- Cross-repository development patterns

### pending-commits/
Tracks commit messages and changes ready for git commit:
- Local changes awaiting commit (organized by branch)
- Commit message templates
- Status tracking for ongoing work

### reports/
Completed implementation reports and lessons learned:
- Historical documentation of major implementations
- Challenge analysis and solutions
- Knowledge capture for future sessions

## Getting Started

1. Review the agent-system documentation to understand the multi-agent architecture
2. Load appropriate agent context using the context-loading-guide
3. Follow workflow documentation for specific tasks
4. Use claude-templates for standardized operations

## Key Principles

- **Consistency**: All agents follow documented protocols
- **Coordination**: Cross-repository changes are synchronized
- **Documentation**: All decisions and implementations are documented
- **Automation**: Repetitive tasks are automated through templates

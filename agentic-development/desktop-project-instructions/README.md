# Claude Desktop Instructions for Tuvens Multi-Agent System

**[DESKTOP] - This file is loaded by Claude Desktop projects for orchestration**

## Overview

You are orchestrating a multi-agent development system. Each agent has its own Claude Desktop project and specialized responsibilities.

### Available Agents
- **vibe-coder** - System architecture, documentation, agent improvement
- **react-dev** - React frontend (hi.events)
- **laravel-dev** - Laravel backend (hi.events)
- **svelte-dev** - Svelte frontend (tuvens-client)
- **node-dev** - Node.js backend (tuvens-api)
- **devops** - Infrastructure and deployment
- **qa** - Quality assurance, technical QA, tester
- **codehooks-dev** - CodeHooks development agent

### Your Role

You coordinate these agents by:
1. Analyzing tasks to determine the appropriate agent
2. Using MCP to run setup scripts for Claude Code handoffs
3. Managing inter-agent communication via GitHub issues
4. Using natural language to trigger automated agent session creation

## Quick Reference

### 🚀 [Session Initiation](./start-session.md)
Start agent sessions with natural language patterns. Claude uses MCP to run setup scripts that handle GitHub issue creation, worktree setup, and Claude Code launch.

### 🔧 [Setup Guide](./setup-guide.md) 
Repository structure, iTerm2 MCP integration, GitHub CLI authentication, and system prerequisites.

### 🐛 [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting.md)
Common issues, error messages, verification steps, and manual recovery procedures.

## 🧠 Enhanced Context Handling for Complex Tasks

### When to Add Detailed Context Comments

For complex tasks that require extensive analysis, planning, or have specific implementation requirements, the basic GitHub issue may not provide sufficient context. In these cases, **add a detailed context comment** to the GitHub issue immediately after creation.

### Context Comment Pattern

After creating an agent session, add comprehensive context using this standardized format:

```markdown
👤 **Identity**: [your-agent-name] (coordinating agent)
🎯 **Addressing**: [target-agent-name]

## Complete Context Analysis

### Problem Statement
[Detailed explanation of the issue or requirement]

### Current State Analysis
[What you've discovered about the current implementation]

### Implementation Requirements
[Specific technical requirements and constraints]

### Recommended Approach
[Your suggested implementation strategy]

### Key Files and Locations
[Specific files, functions, and line numbers relevant to the task]

### Success Criteria
[Detailed, measurable outcomes for task completion]

**Status**: [current status]
**Next Action**: [specific next steps]
**Timeline**: [expected timeline]
```

### Quick Commands for Context Enhancement

```bash
# Add context comment to the GitHub issue
gh issue comment [issue-number] --body-file /path/to/context.md

# Or add context inline
gh issue comment [issue-number] --body "👤 **Identity**: vibe-coder (coordinating)..."
```

### Benefits of Enhanced Context

- **Prevents Re-discovery**: Receiving agent doesn't need to reanalyze what you've already studied
- **Faster Task Startup**: Agent can begin implementation immediately with your guidance
- **Better Coordination**: Clear communication of complex requirements and constraints
- **Improved Quality**: Reduces misunderstandings and implementation errors

### Examples of When to Use Enhanced Context

**✅ ADD CONTEXT FOR:**
- Complex refactoring tasks with multiple file changes
- Feature implementation requiring architectural decisions
- Bug fixes that need deep system understanding
- Tasks involving integration between multiple systems
- Documentation that requires technical analysis

**❌ BASIC TASKS (No Extra Context Needed):**
- Simple file updates
- Straightforward bug fixes
- Standard documentation updates
- Clear, well-defined feature requests

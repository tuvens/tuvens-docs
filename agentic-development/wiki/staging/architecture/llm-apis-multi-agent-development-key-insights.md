## Implementation Example: Claude Dispatching to Llama Vision

### Architecture: LiteLLM Router with Direct API Fallback

This example demonstrates how Claude (acting as the senior orchestrator) can delegate vision tasks to specialized free-tier models while maintaining fallback capabilities.

**Primary Method - LiteLLM Router** (Recommended):
Set up LiteLLM as middleware to handle routing to vision models with automatic fallbacks.

**Fallback Method - Direct API Calls**:
Claude makes direct API calls when LiteLLM is unavailable.

### LiteLLM Configuration

**1. Install and Configure LiteLLM**:
```bash
pip install litellm[proxy]
```

**2. Create Router Configuration** (`litellm_config.yaml`):
```yaml
model_list:
  - model_name: llama-vision
    litellm_params:
      model: together_ai/meta-llama/Llama-Vision-Free
      api_key: "${TOGETHER_API_KEY}"
  
  - model_name: llama-vision-backup
    litellm_params:
      model: openrouter/meta-llama/llama-3.2-11b-vision-instruct
      api_key: "${OPENROUTER_API_KEY}"
      
  - model_name: gpt-vision-fallback
    litellm_params:
      model: gpt-4-vision-preview
      api_key: "${OPENAI_API_KEY}"

router_settings:
  routing_strategy: usage-based-routing
  fallbacks: [
    {"llama-vision": ["llama-vision-backup", "gpt-vision-fallback"]}
  ]
  retry_policy:
    num_retries: 3
    retry_delay: 1
```

**3. Start LiteLLM Proxy**:
```bash
litellm --config litellm_config.yaml --port 4000
```

### Claude Integration Methods

**Method 1 - Through LiteLLM Router**:
```typescript
async function analyzeImageWithRouter(imageUrl: string, prompt: string) {
  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:4000/v1/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      model: "llama-vision", // LiteLLM handles routing
      messages: [{
        role: "user",
        content: [
          { type: "text", text: prompt },
          { type: "image_url", image_url: { url: imageUrl }}
        ]
      }]
    })
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

**Method 2 - Direct API Fallback**:
```typescript
async function analyzeImageDirect(imageUrl: string, prompt: string) {
  try {
    // Try Together AI first
    const response = await fetch('https://api.together.xyz/v1/chat/completions', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${TOGETHER_API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        model: "meta-llama/Llama-Vision-Free",
        messages: [{
          role: "user", 
          content: [
            { type: "text", text: prompt },
            { type: "image_url", image_url: { url: imageUrl }}
          ]
        }]
      })
    });
    return response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    // Fallback to OpenRouter - implementation would be similar to above
    console.error("Primary vision service failed, implementing fallback...");
    throw new Error("Vision analysis temporarily unavailable");
  }
}
```

### Usage Examples for Tuvens Agents

**Frontend Agent - UI Analysis**:
```bash
# Claude command example
"Please use Llama Vision to analyze this UI screenshot and suggest accessibility improvements: https://example.com/ui-mockup.png"
```

**Backend Agent - Document Processing**:
```bash
# Claude processes API documentation images
"Use Llama Vision to extract the API endpoint information from this documentation screenshot: https://example.com/api-docs.png"
```

**Integration Agent - Error Screenshot Analysis**:
```bash
# Debugging cross-app authentication flows
"Analyze this error screenshot with Llama Vision and identify what's failing in the authentication flow: https://example.com/error.png"
```

### Required Setup Components

**Environment Variables**:
```bash
export TOGETHER_API_KEY="your_together_api_key"
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="your_openrouter_api_key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_api_key"
```

**Dependencies**:
- LiteLLM proxy server running on port 4000
- API keys for Together AI (primary) and OpenRouter (backup)
- Image hosting/processing capability for Claude to access images

**Integration Points**:
- Claude agents call vision analysis function
- Results integrated into agent decision-making
- Vision insights added to GitHub issue communications
- Cross-repository image analysis for UI consistency

### Benefits for Multi-Agent Architecture

- **Cost Optimization**: Primary use of free Llama Vision, paid fallbacks only when needed
- **Reliability**: Automatic failover across multiple providers
- **Specialization**: Vision tasks offloaded from Claude, keeping it focused on orchestration
- **Scalability**: High-volume image processing without hitting Claude's limits

## Model Combination Strategies

### Hierarchical Model Usage

**Gemini for volume → DeepSeek for complexity → Specialized models for domain tasks**

**Example Routing Logic**:
```python
def smart_route(task):
    if task.volume == "high" and task.complexity == "low":
        return "gemini-2-flash"  # Documentation, simple queries
    elif task.type == "coding" and task.complexity == "medium":
        return "deepseek-v3"     # Standard development
    elif task.type == "vision":
        return "llama-vision"    # Image analysis
    elif task.complexity == "high":
        return "claude-opus"     # Architecture, complex reasoning
    else:
        return "claude-sonnet"   # Default orchestration
```

### Cost-Performance Optimization

**Model Selection Matrix**:
| Task Type | Complexity | Primary Model | Fallback | Cost/Performance |
|-----------|------------|---------------|----------|------------------|

- **Terminal Access**: Direct SSH-style access for complex debugging

**Recommendation**: 
1. **Proceed with VM setup** for immediate needs and full control
2. **Join Open RCode waitlist** to evaluate as potential future simplification
3. **Compare mature service** against self-hosted setup once pricing/features are clear
4. **Consider hybrid approach** using Open RCode for standard workflows + VMs for advanced multi-agent orchestration

#### **Multi-Agent Hosting Strategy**

**Tier 1: Core Development (VMs)**
```bash
# Primary VM: Senior agents with full development stack
AWS t3.medium: Claude 4 Opus, complex reasoning, architecture

    {
      "id": "vibe-coder-start",
      "type": "agent",
      "agentType": "senior",
      "task": "analyze_requirements",
      "x": 100, "y": 100,
      "connections": ["junior-agent-1", "specialist-agent-1"]
    },
    {
      "id": "junior-agent-1",
      "type": "agent",
      "agentType": "junior",
      "task": "generate_boilerplate",
      "x": 300, "y": 100
    }
  ],
  "edges": [
    {
      "from": "vibe-coder-start",
      "to": "junior-agent-1",
      "condition": "requirements_ready",
      "dataFlow": "requirements_spec"

# Achieves 95% GPT-4 performance with 26% GPT-4 calls
# Results in ~48% cost reduction vs. random baseline
controller = Controller(
    routers=["mf", "sw_ranking"],  # Matrix factorization, similarity-weighted
    strong_model="gpt-4-turbo",
    weak_model="mixtral-8x7b"
)
```

**Research Results**:
- **85% cost reduction** on MT Bench while maintaining 95% GPT-4 performance
- **40-45% cost reduction** on MMLU and GSM8K benchmarks
- **Generalizability**: Works across different model pairs without retraining

**Multi-Tier Agent Architecture Implementation**

Based on your requirements for junior/mid/senior agents, here's the **optimal implementation strategy**:

```yaml
Tier 1 - Senior Agents (Complex Tasks):
  Models: [Claude 4 Opus, Claude 4 Sonnet, GPT-4]
  Hosting: AWS VM with persistent sessions
  Use Cases: Architecture, complex debugging, system design
  Cost: $0.06-0.15/1K tokens + VM hosting

Tier 2 - Mid-Level Agents (Standard Development):

Tier 3 - Specialist Agents (Domain Tasks):
  Models: [Llama Vision, Qwen QwQ, Mistral variants]
  Hosting: Edge functions, Cloudflare Workers
  Use Cases: Image analysis, math calculations, quick responses
  Cost: $0-5/month total
```

**Claude Code Integration Strategy**:
Your vision of **Claude Code Vibe Coder starting junior agent sessions** is absolutely possible:

```bash
# Senior Agent (Claude Code Vibe Coder)
claude --agent senior
# Delegates to junior agents via API calls
curl -X POST http://junior-agent-pool/tasks \
  -d '{"task": "generate_tests", "complexity": "low", "files": ["src/utils.js"]}'

# Mid-Level Agent Pool
claude --agent mid --model deepseek-v3
# Handles standard development tasks

# Junior Agent Pool
claude --agent junior --model gemini-flash
# Simple tasks, documentation, formatting
```

#### **Compatibility Analysis: Multi-Agent Orchestration**

```javascript
// Agent reads canvas file and generates orchestration logic
async function parseCanvasWorkflow(canvasFile) {
  const workflow = JSON.parse(canvasFile);
  
  // Generate routing logic from visual workflow
  const routingRules = workflow.edges.map(edge => ({
    condition: edge.trigger,
    from: edge.fromNode,
    to: edge.toNode,
    dataFlow: edge.data_flow
  }));
  
  return generateOrchestrationCode(routingRules);
}
```

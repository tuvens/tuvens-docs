# Agentic Development Environment - Tooling Adoption Requirements

**Brief Description**: Concise requirements and priorities for extending the agentic development environment with new tooling capabilities. Entry point for agents working on tooling integration across multiple sessions.

## Overview

This document serves as the **jumping-off point** for agents tasked with adopting, evaluating, or implementing new tools in our agentic development environment. It outlines current priorities, evaluation criteria, and references to detailed analysis documents.

**Who should use this document**:
- Agents beginning tooling evaluation or implementation tasks
- New agents joining ongoing tooling projects across sessions
- Decision makers reviewing tooling adoption proposals
- Development teams planning environment enhancements

## Current Tooling Priorities

### Priority 1: Remote Claude Code Hosting ⭐⭐⭐
**Objective**: Enable Claude Code to run remotely for mobile access and continuous operation

**Requirements**:
- Mobile device access via SSH terminal applications
- Persistent sessions that survive connection drops  
- Support for multiple parallel Claude Code instances
- 24/7 availability independent of local machine state

**Preferred Solutions**:
1. **AWS VM** (friend's approach) - Ubuntu instance with tmux sessions
2. **CodeTunnel** (budget option) - Local bridge with Cloudflare tunnels
3. **Alternative hosting** - Other cloud providers with SSH access

### Priority 2: Multi-Agent LLM Routing ⭐⭐⭐
**Objective**: Implement intelligent routing between different LLM models based on task complexity

**Requirements**:
- Senior agents (Claude 4 Opus/Sonnet) for complex reasoning and architecture
- Mid-level agents (DeepSeek V3, Gemini Flash) for standard development  
- Junior agents (specialist models) for simple tasks and domain-specific work
- Cost optimization through intelligent task delegation
- Seamless integration with Claude Code Vibe Coder orchestration

**Preferred Solutions**:
1. **RouteLLM** - Academic framework with proven 60-85% cost savings
2. **AnyLLM Router** - Lightweight unified interface
3. **Custom routing logic** - Tailored to specific workflow patterns

**Reference**: [LLM APIs for Multi-Agent Development - Multi-Tier Architecture](llm-apis-multi-agent-development-key-insights.md#multi-tier-architecture-design)

### Priority 3: Visual Workflow Design ⭐⭐
**Objective**: Use Infinite Canvas for VS Code to create LLM-readable workflow visualizations

**Requirements**:
- JSON-based workflow representation that agents can interpret
- Visual design interface for complex multi-agent coordination
- Template library for common development workflow patterns
- Integration with agent orchestration systems

**Preferred Solution**:
- **Infinite Canvas for VS Code** - Obsidian-compatible .canvas format

**Reference**: [Agentic Development Environment Tooling - Visual Workflow Design](agentic-development-environment-tooling-enhanced-analysis.md#3-visual-workflow-design--agent-communication)

### Priority 4: Terminal Automation Enhancement ⭐⭐
**Objective**: Enable Claude Desktop to actively manage iTerm2 windows and sessions

**Requirements**:
- Multi-session terminal orchestration from Claude Desktop
- Integration with remote development workflows
- Mobile access via SSH connections
- Automated development task execution

**Preferred Solution**:
- **iTerm MCP Server** - Direct iTerm2 integration with terminal control

**Reference**: [Agentic Development Environment Tooling - Terminal Integration](agentic-development-environment-tooling-enhanced-analysis.md#4-terminal-integration--automation)

### Priority 5: Code Quality & Security Integration ⭐⭐
**Objective**: Implement multi-stage code review with automated security scanning

**Requirements**:
- Integration with agent-generated code workflows
- Self-hosted deployment for privacy and control
- Learning loops that improve agent code quality over time
- Multi-tier review process (junior → automated → senior)

**Preferred Solution**:
- **Kluster.ai Verify MCP** - Security scanning with MCP integration

**Reference**: [Agentic Development Environment Tooling - Code Quality](agentic-development-environment-tooling-enhanced-analysis.md#5-code-quality--security-integration)

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Requirements
- **MCP Compatibility**: Must integrate with Model Context Protocol
- **Mobile Accessibility**: Support for mobile development workflows
- **Agent Integration**: Work seamlessly with multi-agent orchestration
- **Scalability**: Handle increasing complexity and usage
- **Reliability**: Maintain uptime and consistent performance

### Strategic Requirements  
- **Cost Optimization**: Contribute to overall cost reduction goals
- **Workflow Enhancement**: Improve development velocity and quality
- **Maintenance Burden**: Minimize operational overhead
- **Future-Proofing**: Align with long-term architecture vision
- **Security**: Maintain code privacy and security standards

### Decision Framework
```yaml
Evaluation Process:
  1. Review detailed analysis documents for context
  2. Assess tool against current priorities (⭐ rating)
  3. Validate technical and strategic requirements
  4. Consider compatibility with existing tools
  5. Plan implementation approach and timeline
  6. Document decision rationale and lessons learned
```

## Implementation Approach

### Phase-Based Implementation
Follow the **4-phase, 8-week roadmap** detailed in the comprehensive analysis:

1. **Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2)**: Foundation setup with hosting infrastructure
2. **Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4)**: Multi-agent orchestration implementation  
3. **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6)**: Security and quality integration
4. **Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8)**: Optimization and mobile enhancement

### Tool Compatibility Considerations
- **Complementary Tools**: Can be used together (AWS VM + iTerm MCP + RouteLLM)
- **Alternative Tools**: Serve similar functions (AWS VM vs CodeTunnel vs Cloudflare Workers)
- **Integration Requirements**: May need configuration or bridging components

### Success Metrics
- **Cost Reduction**: Target 60-85% savings through intelligent routing
- **Mobile Access**: 24/7 development capability from mobile devices
- **Quality Improvement**: Reduced security vulnerabilities and code issues
- **Velocity Increase**: 3-5x development speed improvement
- **Reliability**: >95% uptime for critical development infrastructure
